# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Placement Website Microservices 


- API Gateway Service: This is the single-entry point for all client requests. It routes requests to the appropriate backend service and handles common concerns like authentication, rate limiting, and caching.   

- Auth Service: Handles user authentication via httpOnly cookies; frontend should rely on server responses for user data and not manage JWTs on the client.  

- User Service: Manages user profiles for students, faculties, and companies. This service is the single source of truth for user data and permissions. 

- Placement Service: The central hub for job-related data. It manages job postings, application submissions, and the status of each application. 

- Quiz and Assessments Service: Manages all aspects of technical and aptitude assessments, including question banks, quiz creation, and score tracking. 

- Skill Development Service: Provides educational content, such as roadmaps, tutorials, and links to external resources. 

- Chat Service: Enables real-time communication between different user groups, like students and companies, or students and faculty. 

- File Management Service: Manages all file-related operations, such as uploading and storing resumes, company logos, and other documents. It should also handle file security and access control. 

- Notification Service: A decoupled service that sends all types of notifications (email, SMS, in-app alerts) to users based on events triggered by other services. 

- Analytics Service: Collects, processes, and analyzes data from all other services to generate reports, dashboards, and leaderboards. This service should focus on data insights without impacting the performance of the core services. 

- Logging and Monitoring Service: A centralized service that aggregates logs and metrics from all microservices. This is critical for debugging, performance monitoring, and ensuring system health. This service would use tools like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or a similar solution. 

- Payment Service: If you decide to monetize certain features, like premium company profiles or featured job postings, this service will handle all payment processing and billing logic. (not so important) 

- Recommendation Service: This service would use machine learning to suggest relevant jobs to students and recommend suitable candidates to companies based on their profiles and past interactions. (not so important) 

- Search Service: A dedicated, highly optimized search service that provides lightning-fast search capabilities across all job postings, user profiles, and skill development resources. This can be built using technologies like Elasticsearch or Algolia. (not so important) 















all possible frontend pages(gemini) : 

That's an excellent next step! Defining the frontend pages for each role is crucial for scoping the work and ensuring a great User Experience (UX).

The microservices you defined (Auth, User, Placement, Quiz, etc.) will primarily act as the back-end APIs to support these pages.

Here is a comprehensive list of the core frontend pages and features for each role:
